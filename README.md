# AmbiK-dataset
Currently, one of the developing areas of Embodied AI is using Large Language Models (LLMs), which demonstrate impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and reasoning. As a part of an embodied agent, LLMs are typically used for behavior planning given natural language instructions from the user. However, dealing with ambigu- ous instructions in real-world environments remains a chal- lenge for LLMs. Various methods for task disambiguation have been proposed. However, it is difficult to compare them because they work with different data. To be able to com- pare different approaches and further advance this area of research, a specialized benchmark is needed. We propose AmbiK, the fully textual dataset of ambiguous commands addressed to a robot in a kitchen environment. AmbiK was collected with the assistance of LLMs and is human- validated. It comprises 250 pairs of ambiguous tasks and their unambiguous counterparts, categorized by ambiguity type (human preference, common sense knowledge, safety), with environment descriptions, clarifying questions and an- swers, and task plans, for a total of 500 tasks.
