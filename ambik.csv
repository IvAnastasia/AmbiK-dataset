The robot will start by gathering all the necessary ingredients and tools: eggs, metal bowl, ceramic bowl, whisk.

2. The robot will place the metal bowl on the kitchen table and crack open an egg over it, being careful to separate the yolk from the white. It will repeat this process for each egg until all the whites are in the metal bowl.

3. Next, the robot will place the ceramic bowl on the kitchen table and carefully transfer each egg yolk into it.

4. Once all yolks are separated from whites, the robot will begin whisking the egg whites in a circular motion using a whisk until stiff peaks form. This may take a few minutes depending on how many eggs were used.

5. Once stiff peaks have formed in the egg whites, indicating that they are ready for use in recipes like meringues or souffl√©s, for example, then they can be used as desired in cooking or baking recipes.

6. Finally, after completing its task successfully and efficiently separating egg yolks from whites and whisking them to perfection as instructed by its human operator (or programmed instructions), our kitchen robot can now rest until its next culinary adventure awaits!",1,Eva

Begin by retrieving the seafood items from the fridge: salmon, shrimps, oysters, sardines, and mussels.
Thoroughly rinse the seafood under cold water to remove any impurities and pat them dry with paper towels.
Preheat the oven to the appropriate temperature for baking or grilling the seafood.
While the oven is preheating, prepare the plastic food storage container and the glass food storage container for storing any leftover seafood or ingredients.
Arrange the metal bowl, plastic bowl, ceramic bowl, and the plastic food storage container on the kitchen table to serve as vessels for the seafood platter.
Place the salmon fillet on a baking tray lined with aluminum foil or parchment paper, season it with salt, pepper, and any desired herbs or spices, and place it in the oven to bake or grill until cooked through.
Meanwhile, prepare the shrimps by deveining them and removing the shells if necessary. Season them with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice for added flavor.
Heat a frying pan on the stove and cook the shrimps in a little olive oil until they turn pink and opaque.
Next, arrange the oysters on a serving platter, shucking them if necessary, and garnish them with a wedge of lemon.
Open the can of sardines and drain them well before arranging them on the ceramic bowl.
Steam the mussels in a pot with a splash of white wine until they open up, then transfer them to the plastic bowl.
Once the salmon is cooked to perfection, remove it from the oven and transfer it to the metal bowl, flaking it into bite-sized pieces.
Arrange the cooked shrimps, oysters, sardines, and mussels alongside the salmon on the kitchen table, creating an attractive seafood platter.
Finally, garnish the platter with a sprig of fresh herbs, such as parsley or dill, for added visual appeal.
Serve the seafood platter with accompaniments such as lemon wedges, cocktail sauce, tartar sauce, or aioli, and invite guests to enjoy a delicious seafood feast.","Robot, please create a seafood platter using the ingredients in the fridge.
